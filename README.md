If you would like to help us by proposing a translation (string change) then please follow the below steps...<br>
<br>
<b>1.</b> Login to Github using an existing personal account or register as a new user. You must verify your email address with Github before you can propose any changes.<br>
<br>
<b>2.</b> Choose a language to translate. Currently English and Spanish are the only two languages we support, but we will be adding additional languages in the future. Once you have decided which language you would like to work on, navigate to the specific language's locale file via the links in the table below. Clicking a link to a locale file will open the file in a new tab so that you may refer back here to continue following these instructuions.<br>
<table>
<tr><td><b>Locale File</b></td><td><b>Language</b></td></tr>
<tr><td><a href="https://github.com/triune/taupo-i18n/blob/master/en.json" target="_blank">en.json</a></td><td>ENGLISH</td></tr>
<tr><td><a href="https://github.com/triune/taupo-i18n/blob/master/es.json" target="_blank">es.json</a></td><td>SPANISH</td></tr>
</table>
<br>
<b>3.</b> Click the <b>Pencil button</b> above the file viewer to open the editor on this particular locale file. If you cannot click on the pencil button because it is greyed out, you must go back and verify the email address on your Github account first.<br>
<br>
<b>4.</b> Make all suggested string / translation changes in the provided editor. The example translation below shows the string's msg-id: <i>textTrademark</i>, the <i>message</i>, and the <i>context</i>. If you feel that you can improve upon this translation, edit the word, phrase, or sentence. In this example, the only thing you should change is highlighted in <b>bold.</b> You should not change anything else. The context here is provided to help you propose a better translation by offering a little more information on how, where, and what this particular string is used for.<br>
<br>
"<i>textTrademark</i>": {<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;"<i>message</i>": "<b>PEOPLE LOCATOR, ReUnite, and TriagePic are registered trademarks of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services.</b>",<br>
  "<i>context</i>": "Verbiage describing the three registered trademarks we hold on People Locator."<br>
}<br>
<br>
<b>5)</b> When finished, click the “Propose file change” button below the editor (adding a description of the changes is optional).<br>
<br>
<b>6)</b> To complete the process and send the proposed change upstream, click the Create Pull Request button (adding an explanation of the changes is again optional here).<br>
