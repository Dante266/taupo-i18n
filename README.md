If you would like to propose a translation (string change) for us, please follow the below steps:<br>
<br>
<b>1)</b> Login to Github (register a new account or use an existing personal account)<br>
<br>
<b>2)</b> Choose a language to translate, (currently English and Spanish are the only two choices) and then click on the appropriate locale file:<br>
<a href="https://github.com/triune/taupo-i18n/blob/master/en.json" target="_blank">en.json</a> ENGLISH locale<br>
<a href="https://github.com/triune/taupo-i18n/blob/master/es.json" target="_blank">es.json</a> SPANISH locale<br>
<br>
<b>3)</b> Click the Pencil button to edit the locale file.<br>
<br>
<b>4)</b> Make all suggested string / translation changes in the provided editor.<br>
<br>
The example string below shows the string's msg-id: <b>textTrademark</b>, the <b>message</b>, and the <b>context</b>. If you feel that you can improve on the translation offered in the message body, edit this word, phrase, or sentence. This is the only place you should make any changes.<br>
<br>
"textTrademark": {<br>
  "message": "PEOPLE LOCATOR, ReUnite, and TriagePic are registered trademarks of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services.",<br>
  "context": "Verbiage describing the three registered trademarks we hold on People Locator."<br>
}<br>
<br>
<b>5)</b> When finished, click the “Propose file change” button below the editor (adding a description of the changes is optional).<br>
<br>
<b>6)</b> To complete the process and send the proposed change upstream, click the Create Pull Request button (adding an explanation of the changes is again optional here).<br>
