If you would like to propose a translation (string change) for us, please follow the below steps:<br>
<br>
<b>1)</b> Login to Github using an existing personal account or register as a new user. You must verify your email address with Github before you can propose any changes.<br>
<br>
<b>2)</b> Choose a language/locale to translate. Currently English and Spanish are the only two locales we support, but we will be adding more in the future. Once you know which language you would like to work on, navigate to the specific language's locale file:<br>
<br>
| Locale File | Language |
| ----------- | -------- |
| <a href="https://github.com/triune/taupo-i18n/blob/master/en.json" target="_blank">en.json</a> | ENGLISH |
| <a href="https://github.com/triune/taupo-i18n/blob/master/es.json" target="_blank">es.json</a> | SPANISH |
<br>
<b>3)</b> Click the Pencil button to edit the locale file.<br>
<br>
<b>4)</b> Make all suggested string / translation changes in the provided editor.<br>
<br>
The example string below shows the string's msg-id: <b>textTrademark</b>, the <b>message</b>, and the <b>context</b>. If you feel that you can improve on the translation offered in the message body, edit this word, phrase, or sentence. This is the only place you should make any changes.<br>
<br>
"textTrademark": {<br>
  "message": "PEOPLE LOCATOR, ReUnite, and TriagePic are registered trademarks of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services.",<br>
  "context": "Verbiage describing the three registered trademarks we hold on People Locator."<br>
}<br>
<br>
<b>5)</b> When finished, click the “Propose file change” button below the editor (adding a description of the changes is optional).<br>
<br>
<b>6)</b> To complete the process and send the proposed change upstream, click the Create Pull Request button (adding an explanation of the changes is again optional here).<br>
